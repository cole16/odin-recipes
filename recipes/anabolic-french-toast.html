        <h2>A delicious high-protein breakfast meal to prepare you for an intense day of training!</h3>
            <p>Ordinary french toast is not quite the best breakfast meal if you're looking to pack on muscle. It is often prepared with tons of sugar and cream. With just a few tweaks, you can reduce the calories and increase the protein, all while still making a delightful breakfast!</p>
            <p>Also, this is a <strong>VERY</strong> simple recipe. There's a grand total of <em>six</em> ingredients!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Bread</li>
                <li>Eggs</li>
                <li>Milk</li>
                <li>Protein Powder</li>
                <li>Cinnamon</li>
                <li>Vanilla Extract</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Start by whisking together all the ingredients (except for the bread of course). Once combined, dip each slice of bread in the mixture until fully coated </li>
                <li>Add cooking spray onto a non-stick pan and place it over medium heat. Once hot, add the soaked bread and cook for 6-7 minutes, flipping halfway through.</li>
                <li>Repeat this process until all the bread has been cooked.</li>
                <li>Serve immediately!</li>
            </ol>
